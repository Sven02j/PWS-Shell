# PWS-Shell
PWS-Shell

(Code itself is partially dutch)

This project has been made for a profile paper. As it is the final version, it will likely not be updated anymore. If this project continues, it will most likely be on another branch with a different name.

ffmpeg.exe is not included in this branch as it is too large for GitHub.

The empty config file 'ShellDebugMode' is not included in this project. This file will run the shell in debug mode. Debug mode offers:
- No startup programs
- Enables Alt + F4

To enable this mode when running the shell, create a file 'ShellDebugMode' in the same directory as 'PWS-Shell.exe'
